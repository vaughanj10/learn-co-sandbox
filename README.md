Hi! 👋

You've opened the IDE Sandbox,an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code!

IMPORTANT
Saving varies by type of work you are doing:
* Most of the work you do in the Sandbox is automatically saved on your behalf to the `learn-co-sandbox` repository in your GitHub account. Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub, as it will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to be out of sync.
* Git repositories that you clone* into the Sandbox are NOT automatically saved. In this case, you are responsible for committing and pushing your work to GitHub.
